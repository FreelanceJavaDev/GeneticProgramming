# GeneticProgramming
 Experiment transforming genomic sequences into executables.

## The concept
This project began as several years ago as a joke about DNA being "God's change log". But the more I thought about it the more DNA felt like a program to me. I soon forgot about it other than as a science fiction plot device. I decided to give it a chance as a way to learn Rust that kept my interest and leverage what I learned at a genetic sequencing company in an entirely different concept.

## Compilation methods
All the methods center around converting a base-4 code (A, T, C & G) into a base 2 code (0 & 1). They all involve using two bits for each base. 
Method 1. The ASCII masking & bit shift trick
	This is the most obvious one to software engineers.
	From the ASCII table A, C, T and G can be uniquely mapped to two bits by the bitwise expression `(Q & 0x06) >> 1`.

	This maps A => 00, C => 01, T => 10 and G => 11.
	However this only applies to capital letters.

Method 2. The Biological base pair complement map
	This method is one biologists would prefer. It also makes the most sense for a program encoded in DNA. In DNA most of the time A binds with T and C binds with G. These pairings can be seen as complemental pairings.
	This does require an ASCII table to map the sequences into the proper mapping. Though this mapping can be modified easily. The first will seem a bit like the first method.
	The mapping that is currently implemented is A => 00, C => 01, G => 10 and T => 11

Method 3. The ASCII Table dynamic map. (unimplemented)
	This mapping is a variation on the biological base pair compliment map and the remaining mappings that aren't covered under the previous methods.


## Testing and Examining results
It is expected nobody should run a program of unknown origin or purpose their computer without examining it first.
The conventional method is a disassembler. This is used to examine computer virus code to determine what they do. Cutter was used for examining the resulting executables. The first organism tested is in the family with the oldest form of life Cyanobacteria. Specifically a _Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii_ strain. It also has everything in a single chromosome.

Method 1 and 2 have been tested. Method one didn't produce interesting results. There wasn't enough structure from a quick glance and most of it was invalid. Method two's compliment map on the other hand produced three assembly functions that weren't useless and a most of the code resulted in actual assembly code (at least on AMD).
Among the functions is are (rotate_right32 was generated by a C decompiler):
``` c
uint32_t rotate_right32 (uint32_t value, uint32_t count) {
    const uint32_t mask = (CHAR_BIT * sizeof (value)) - 1;
    count &= mask;
    return (value >> count) | (value << (-count & mask));
}
 
void fcn_00061022 (void) {
    esp = rotate_right32 (esp, cl);
}

int8_t fcn_00000000 (void) {
    if (? >= ?) {
        al = *(rsi);
        rsi++;
        edi = 0x15939134;
    }
    __asm ("cli");
    al -= 0xfc;
    al += 0x52;
    bl ^= dh;
    al += 0x87;
}

void fcn_000dca2c (void) {
    __asm ("retf");
}
```
